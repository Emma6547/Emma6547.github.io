This data set from TidyTuesday originates from a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QguM-JM3LAJuZlnmY8aN0MutBJrZAzDs3aWZWTtF1WU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) compiled by Chris Eckert. It compares Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Albums of All Time” lists from 2003, 2012, and 2020 and includes information on each album's name, genre, release year, 2003/2012/2020 rank, the artist’s name, birth year, gender, and more. This analysis looks at the trend in the production of the "greatest" albums over time. Which years were the most fruitful? Do the top 500 albums largely consist of older ones, or more recent ones?

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 19)

rolling_stone <- tuesdata$rolling_stone

# wrangling data to count the number of distinct albums in the list released each year

rolling_stone_df <- rolling_stone |> 
  group_by(release_year) |> 
  summarize(num_per_year = n_distinct(album))

# creating a scatterplot

ggplot(rolling_stone_df, aes(x = release_year, y = num_per_year)) +
  geom_point(color = "cadetblue") +
  geom_line(color = "cadetblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of All Time",
    x = "Release Year",
    y = "Number of Albums Included in Top 500 Ranking",
    alt = "Scatterplot demonstrating the number of albums in the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest
    Albums list realeased each year. Album releases peaked in 1970, fell around 1980 and 
    curved upwards again towards the 90s, after which the number of albums included in 
    the ranking sank as 2020 was approached."
  )
