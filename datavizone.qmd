This data is from TidyTuesday and is sourced from the National Endowment for the Arts. It gives state-level estimates for the total number of artists and for each individual type of artist in the workforce, covering 2015-2019. This analysis examines the total number of workers in the music industry specifically (musicians, music directors, and composers) and compares the totals across races.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-09-27')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2022, week = 39)

artists <- tuesdata$artists

artists2 <- artists %>%
  mutate(Music_Industry = str_detect(type, "Music")) %>%
  filter(Music_Industry == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarize(total_musicians = sum(artists_n, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(race = fct_reorder(race, total_musicians, .desc = TRUE))


ggplot(artists2, aes(x = race, y = total_musicians)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Music Industry Professionals Across Races in the US",
    x = "Race",
    y = "Number working as Musicians, Music Directors, or Composers",
  )
